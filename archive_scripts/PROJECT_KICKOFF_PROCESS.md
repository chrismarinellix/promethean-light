# Project Kick-Off Process

## Purpose
This document outlines the mandatory kick-off process for all project engagements to ensure clear scope definition, role clarity, and prevent methodological conflicts.

## Pre-Kickoff Checklist

### 1. Client Classification
Determine the client type:
- **Developer/Asset Owner** (e.g., OX2) - owns the asset, has in-house teams
- **Consultant** - provides advisory services to developers
- **EPC Contractor** - engineering, procurement, and construction
- **Other** - specify

### 2. Technical Capability Assessment
Document the client's technical capabilities:
- [ ] Does the client have an in-house technical team?
- [ ] What studies/work will the in-house team perform?
- [ ] What specific deliverables are they requesting from us?

### 3. **CRITICAL: Third-Party Technical Consultant Check**

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION:**

Before finalizing any engagement, explicitly verify:

- [ ] **Are there any other technical consultants currently engaged on this project?**
- [ ] **If yes, what is their scope of work?**
- [ ] **Are they providing technical direction or methodology guidance?**

**RED FLAG CONDITIONS:**

If another technical consultant is:
- Providing technical direction
- Defining methodologies
- Overseeing technical studies
- Setting technical requirements that conflict with our approach

**ACTION REQUIRED:** Stop and escalate to project leadership before proceeding.

**RATIONALE:** We cannot have impacts to our own methodology. Multiple consultants providing conflicting technical direction will compromise:
- Study quality and consistency
- Methodological integrity
- Deliverable reliability
- Project timeline and efficiency

## Kick-Off Meeting Agenda

### 1. Introductions and Roles
- Client team members and their roles
- Our team members and responsibilities
- Any third-party consultants and their defined scope

### 2. Project Scope Clarification
- What work is the client performing in-house?
- What work are we responsible for?
- Clear boundaries and interfaces

### 3. Technical Methodology Alignment
- Confirm our methodology approach
- Identify any client-specific requirements
- **Verify no conflicting technical direction from other parties**

### 4. Study Scope Definition

#### Wide Area Studies
- Who is responsible? (Clarify if client in-house team or us)
- Study boundaries and requirements
- Deliverable format and timeline

#### Technical Studies
- Detailed scope breakdown
- Responsibilities matrix
- Interface points

#### Due Diligence
- What aspect of due diligence is being performed?
- By whom?
- How does it relate to our scope?

### 5. Deliverables and Timeline
- Specific deliverables list
- Quality standards
- Review and approval process
- Key milestones

### 6. Communication Protocol
- Primary points of contact
- Meeting cadence
- Issue escalation path

## Example Scenario: OX2 Corop Project

**Client Type:** Developer/Asset Owner

**Client Capabilities:**

- Due diligence leadership
- Overall project technical direction (client-led)

## Sign-Off

After kick-off meeting, document and obtain sign-off on:

1. **Scope Confirmation**
   - Clear definition of our scope vs. client scope vs. any third-party scope

2. **No Methodology Conflicts**
   - Confirmed no other technical consultants providing conflicting direction
   - Our methodology approach is accepted and will not be overridden
