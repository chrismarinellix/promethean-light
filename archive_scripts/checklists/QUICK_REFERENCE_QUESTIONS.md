## HOW TO ASK (Natural Conversation)

**Don't:** Read questions like a robot checklist
**Do:** Weave them into natural conversation

**Example Flow:**

"So, how are things looking from your end this week?"
↳ *Listen for satisfaction/concerns*

"We're on track to deliver [X] by [date]. Does that still work for your timeline?"
↳ *Check schedule alignment*

"Has anything new come up that we should be thinking about?"
↳ *Scope change detector*

"Is there anything you're waiting on from us, or anything we're waiting on from you?"
↳ *Actions and blockers*

"Just checking - is there anything keeping you up at night about this project?"
↳ *Unspoken concerns*

**Remember:** These questions save you from:
- Scope disputes ("You never told us that!")
- Unhappy clients ("We didn't realize you were frustrated!")
- Timeline failures ("We didn't know you needed it sooner!")
- Budget overruns ("When did this become out of scope?!")

**5-10 minutes weekly prevents hours of problems.**
