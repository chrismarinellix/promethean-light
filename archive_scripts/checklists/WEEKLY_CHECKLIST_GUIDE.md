# Weekly Client Checklist - User Guide

## Purpose

This standardized checklist ensures all engineers:
- Capture scope changes systematically
- Identify client satisfaction issues early
- Track project health consistently
- Generate meaningful weekly summaries for clients and management

---

## How to Use This Checklist

### During Client Meetings/Calls

1. **Keep the checklist open** during your weekly client sync
2. **Check boxes as you go** - quick and easy during conversation
3. **Add brief notes** where needed (don't write essays)
4. **Complete any unchecked items** after the call from memory/notes

### Between Client Meetings

- Use the checklist as a **conversation guide** if you don't have regular meetings
- Send the key questions via email and fill in responses
- Review project status weekly even without direct client contact

---

## Completing the Checklist

### Time Required
- **During meeting:** 0 minutes (just check boxes as you talk)
- **After meeting:** 5-10 minutes to add notes and complete

### Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Complete within 24 hours of client interaction
- Be honest about project health (Yellow/Red ratings help us help you)
- Flag scope changes immediately, even if informal
- Note client dissatisfaction early - it's easier to fix
- Keep notes brief but specific

❌ **DON'T:**
- Leave it blank - even "no change" is valuable
- Sugarcoat problems - we need the real picture
- Wait until Friday afternoon to fill out the week
- Skip sections - every section matters

## Red Flags to Escalate Immediately

Even if it's mid-week, flag these to your PM immediately:

🚨 **Urgent Escalation Items:**
- Client expressing serious dissatisfaction
- Scope change that's >20% of project value
- Client making significant out-of-scope requests
- Project health going from Green to Red in one week
- Client threatening to stop work or withhold payment
- Safety or compliance issues
- Deadline that cannot be met

## Integration with Promethean Light

```

[Paste your completed checklist]
```

This allows you to:
- Search historical client feedback
- Track scope changes over time
- Analyze satisfaction trends
- Generate reports across projects

---

## Team-Wide Benefits

When everyone uses this system:

1. **Consistent Communication** - Clients get similar quality across all engineers
2. **Early Warning System** - Problems flagged before they become critical
3. **Scope Control** - Changes documented when first mentioned
4. **Knowledge Sharing** - Team can see patterns across projects
5. **Professional Development** - Junior engineers learn what to track
6. **Client Satisfaction** - Proactive communication builds trust

---

## Customization

This template can be adapted for your specific project:

- **Add project-specific questions** (e.g., specific to solar/wind/BESS)
- **Remove sections** not relevant to your work
- **Add stakeholders** if you have multiple client contacts

Just maintain the core sections:
- Scope changes (Section 2)
- Client satisfaction (Section 4)
- Overall health (Section 10)

---

## Questions?

If you're unsure how to complete any section, ask:
- Your PM for guidance
- A senior engineer for examples
- The team lead for clarification

The goal is **useful information, not perfect documentation.**

---
